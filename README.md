# A LaTeX CV template

* `CV.tex`: This is a latex source file using the the style `res.sty` (.tex in line 1).
* `res.sty`: This is the style file cited by `CV.tex`.

The above two files should be put in the same folder. This template uses the font `Palatino Linotype` (.tex in line 15). Please make sure your computer has already installed that font.

**Recommended compiler:** XeLaTeX (in TeXstudio, find `Configure TeXstudio` function, choose `Build` in left sidebar, change `Default Compiler` to `XeLaTeX`.)
